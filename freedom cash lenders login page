Nonprofit credit counseling: Nonprofit organizations offer financial counseling for those who struggle with debt. Though not all counselors may be able to negotiate with payday lenders directly, they can look at your overall financial picture and evaluate the best options for addressing payday debt. Some nonprofit credit counseling services are free, while others may require a fee.

Borrow from family or friends: Close family and friends may be a resource if they’re willing to spot you emergency cash to repay your payday loans. Make sure to draw up a loan agreement to avoid any miscommunication about when and how you’ll pay them back.
