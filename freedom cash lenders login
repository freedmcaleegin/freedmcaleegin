Once you have the money, go to each payday lender and pay off your individual debts. This step is the most important; if you skip it and use the money elsewhere, you could end up even deeper in debt.

Once your debts are paid off, make a plan to pay off your personal loan. Missed payments can mean a late fee, and payments received 30 or more days past due can be reported to the credit bureaus, jeopardizing your credit score.
