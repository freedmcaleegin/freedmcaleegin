One way to avoid having to take a payday loan in the future is to build an emergency fund, which is cash set aside to cover unexpected expenses. Even a $500 emergency fund can keep you out of payday debt.

Building an emergency fund takes time, though, so if you need immediate cash, these alternatives are less predatory than payday loans and donâ€™t require good credit.
